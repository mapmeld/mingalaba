Mingalaba is an in-browser editor for manipulating multilingual strings and text.

When I am editing Unicode in my source code, SQL, regular expressions, and general text,
these are operations that I want to be able to do quickly:

- break a set of characters down into its individual pieces (နိုင် -> န ိ ု င ်) for easy copy-paste
- diff two strings to see where they don't match
- see any invisible / missing code points
- look up any code point's meaning
- run SQL and regular expressions against sample data
